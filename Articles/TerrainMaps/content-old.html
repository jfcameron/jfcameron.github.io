                    The Shader Model 5.0 program consists of a vertex shader, geometry and a fragment shader. The Shader Model 3.0 fallback program lacks the geometry shader.
                    Unfortunately 3 is the lowest model possible, being the first standard that introduced texture lookups in the vertex shader, without which displacement maps cannot
                    be used.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The red channel is used by the vertex shader to displace the vertex height. 
                    The vertex shader then recalculates the vertex normal before releasing the vertex for primitive assembly. 
                    The geometry shader pulls in primitives as triangles. The first thing it does is pass through the incoming triangle to the primitive output stream. 
                    Then it uses the primitive’s mesh coordinates x and z components (its position within the input plane mesh), converts those to uvs (mesh size is 100x100, 
                    so divide the coord by this, giving you the equivalent position in uv space) and look at the value of the green channel in the texel at that position. 
                    Depending on the value in the green channel, a different kind of foliage will be generated, which means additional geometry has to be added to the output stream. 
                    Two intersecting, orthogonal quads are generated and placed at the height of the current triangle. Depending on the primitive’s height, the uvs for these quads are 
                    offset, so that during coloring in the fragment shader, the demo will render snow covered trees at high elevations, green trees at low elevations. A slight time variant 
                    horizontal offset is added to the top of the quads too to represent the breeze.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Part of the fragment format is an int that stores type. These types are Terrain, Foliage1, Foliage2, etc. Type is used to determine which diffuse texture to use. 
                    Diffuse texture used for the terrain holds coloring for grass, which is used when the normal is pointing up, and rocks, when the normal is pointing to the side. 
                    As the frag’s height increases, the color is increasingly blended white to represent mountain peak snow covering. If the height is sufficiently low, there is it is 
                    blended blue to represent water. The demo camera is setup at a perspective where the water coloring trick works quite well.
