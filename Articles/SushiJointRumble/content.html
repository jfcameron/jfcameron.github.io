                <h1>Overview</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Sushi Joint Rumble was the name of my final project in the Game Development program at Algonquin College.
                    It was a group project, starting with 7 people but eventually shrinking down to 5.
                    For 3 semesters, up to 50% of my individual mark depended on how well we performed as a group.
                    My role in the group was as lead coder. My time was split between coding features myself and discussing and planning how other coders
                    would take care of their tasks.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Documentation and good tech design were very important to the coders being able to smoothly collaborate on the project. New features were 
                    always created in their own branches, and only once the feature was complete would it be integrated into the trunk. Every source code file had a change log, and
                    especially complex functions had change logs as well.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    We tried to reduce type dependency as much as possible by instead depending on interfaces to connect the various game systems. For example,
                    I remember we needed to write multiple, interdependent systems at the same time. A loot generator, and the AI manager. The loot generator
                    created pickups for the player when an enemy died. It required AI manager information as input. The AI manager required loot information
                    when generating AIs to determine AI stat values. We defined the interfaces between the two systems, then created branches and tackled them
                    separately, as individual features. Once they were finished, snapping them together was fairly trivial.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The team was split into three roles: programmers, designers, artists. For the first 2 semesters, these were pretty loose. People bounced around
                    quite a bit, picking up an art task here and a coding task there. By the end of it, we had specialized quite a bit. With the pressure of graduation
                    looming, it made more sense to stick with what you were fastest at.
