Project for my GitHub account website.

The website makes use of my WebGL Game Engine project.
The game engine in turn makes use of the GLMatrix and Cannon projects.
licenses for these projects can be found in /Docs.

GLMatrix: http://glmatrix.net/
Math library with useful types and operations for 3d graphics.

Cannon: http://cannonjs.org/
Rigidbody physics for JS applications.
